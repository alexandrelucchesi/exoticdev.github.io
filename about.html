<p>Someone or something that is foreign and unusual in a specially interesting way.</p>

<p>An exotic developer is exactly how I feel as a functional programming enthusiast living in a world full of (side-)effects.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, maybe it’s different in the place you live, but at least here in Brazil everything seems so object-oriented. I wonder if it has something to do with our colonization process, you know, all that imperative culture brought by our fellow Portuguese conquerers…</p>
<p>Jokes apart, this blog is an old plan that I’ve decided to put in practice so that I could share my findings and opinions on software development, with strong emphasis in functional programming. Also, I believe it’s going to give me good opportunities to learn, teach and connect deeper with this community.</p>
<p>My personal story with computing is quite long and I don’t intend to get you bored upfront. Also, I must admit that I’ve got a bit lazy after Haskell (bad pun intended).</p>
<p>So, for now, I’ll just tell you that if you enjoy studying programming languages, learning fancy hacks and, once in a while, doing something practical with all of that, then you’re like me and you’re probably going to have some fun in this blog!</p>
<p>Finally, I can’t let you go before encouraging you to give this blog a try and <a href="#">subscribe to the mailing list</a>. Also, if you find any typos (grammar, spelling, language misuse, etc), they are very welcome.</p>
<p>Hope you have a good time here…</p>
<p>See you around, exotic fella!</p>
