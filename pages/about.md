**Exotic**

  ~ Someone or something that is foreign and unusual in an especially
  interesting way.

An exotic developer is how I feel as a functional programming enthusiast living
in a world full of (side-)effects.

I don't know about the place you live, but here in Brazil everything is still so
object-oriented... I wonder if it has something to do with our colonization
process, you know, all that imperative culture brought by our fellow Portuguese
conquerors...

Jokes apart, this blog is an old plan that I've decided to put in practice so
that I can share my findings and opinions on software development, with strong
emphasis on functional programming in Haskell. Also, I believe it's going to
give me good opportunities to learn, teach and connect deeper with this
community.

My personal story with computing is somewhat long and I don't intend to get you
bored upfront (bad rhyme not intended). Also, I must admit that I've got a bit
lazy after Haskell (bad pun intended).

So, for now, I'll just tell you that if you enjoy studying programming
languages, learning fancy hacks and, once in a while, doing something practical
with all of that, then you're probably going to like this blog!

I can't let you go before further encouraging you to give this blog a try and
[subscribe to the mailing list](/contact#subscribe).  Also, if you find any
typos (grammar, spelling, language misuse, etc), they are very welcome. ðŸ™ƒ

Hope you have a good time here...

See you around, exotic fella!
