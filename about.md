**exotic**

  ~ Someone or something that is foreign and unusual in a specially interesting
    way.

An exotic developer is exactly how I feel as a functional programming enthusiast
living in a world full of (side-)effects.

I don't know about you, maybe it's different in the place you live, but at least
here in Brazil everything seems so object-oriented. I wonder if it has something
to do with our colonization process, you know, all that imperative culture
brought by our fellow Portuguese conquerers...

Jokes apart, this blog is an old plan that I've decided to put in practice so
that I could share my findings and opinions on software development, with strong
emphasis in functional programming. Also, I believe it's going to give me good
opportunities to learn, teach and connect deeper with this community.

My personal story with computing is quite long and I don't intend to get you
bored upfront. Also, I must admit that I've got a bit lazy after Haskell (bad
pun intended).

So, for now, I'll just tell you that if you enjoy studying programming
languages, learning fancy hacks and, once in a while, doing something practical
with all of that, then you're probably going to like this blog!

Finally, I can't let you go before encouraging you to give this blog a try and
[subscribe to the mailing list](#). Also, if you find any typos (grammar,
spelling, language misuse, etc), they are very welcome.

Hope you have a good time here...

See you around, exotic fella!
