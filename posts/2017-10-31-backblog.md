Each post buys you one development task:

  1. Start your blog with the bare minimum (nothing fancy allowed). 
  2. List whatever you want to implement to make your blog better.
  3. You're allowed to pick one as soon as you publish a new post.

That's it! If you love programming as I do, by using your productivity as
currency to code, I bet you'll soon become very _agile_ in writing.

## Check out my "always being updated" list
