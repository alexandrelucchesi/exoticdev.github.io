title: "Develop Your Website in Haskell"

Did you know that it's possible to create a website using Haskell? As incredible
as it may sound, Haskell is not (only) some obscure programming language, full
of super abstract concepts and no practical application, used only by crazy
academics and mathematicians.

If those words are obvious and non-sense to you, congratulations, but truth is
there are many people out there thinking of Haskell as a "limiting language".

Think about it: we are living cloudy times in computing...

Nowadays, it's so common to find developers judging the usefulness and relevance
of technologies through a rationale that goes something like this:

\[Put the graph in here!\]

Obviously this is a hypothetic and merely illustrative curve, so don't take it
seriously (even because I have strong reasons to believe it should be closer to
$f(x) = k \times e^{x}$ in real life). :wink:

Anyway, the fact is that the metric "how easy it is to build a website with
technology X" has spread and reached a point where it can no longer be ignored.

For that reason, I decided to write this tutorial. We are going to develop from
the ground up a **website in Haskell**, and hopefully you'll convince yourself
that one PhD in Mathematics and a second in Computer Science are not required to
make useful stuff using Haskell.

## Our Goal

We'll go **beyond the modern "Hello, world!"** and create the basic structure of
a gift list website using [Bootstrap](#) and [Heist](#). Additionaly, you'll
learn to avoid a lot of headaches by correctly configuring your development
environment using [Docker](#) and [Stack](#).

  > Ok, but, hold on... Gift list? How is that practical?

Well, maybe you don't know, but I got married this year and I can tell you:
there's no better idea than to help your friends/family to buy you something
through your self developed gift list website powered by Haskell^{tm}.

So, think about this tutorial as an investment in your life: finish it and all
you'll have left is a willing bride...
